Facilitated by the proliferation of online marketplaces that bring such users together, data brokers need to serve requests where they provide results for user queries over the underlying datasets, and price them fairly according to the information disclosed by the query. In this work, we present a novel pricing system, called Qirana, that performs query-based data pricing for a large class of {SQL} queries (including aggregation) in real time. Qirana provides prices with formal guarantees: for example, it avoids prices that create arbitrage opportunities. Our framework also allows ﬂexible pricing, by allowing the data seller to choose from a variety of pricing functions, as well as specify relation and attribute-level parameters that control the price of queries and assign diﬀerent value to diﬀerent portions of the data. We test Qirana on a variety of real-world datasets and query workloads, and we show that it can eﬃciently compute the prices for queries over large-scale data.},

Despite the importance that prices take in organizations, it appears that this element has not received proper attention by many academics and marketers since it represents, according to estimates, less than 2\% of the papers on leading journals in the ﬁeld. Thus, the aim of this study was to propose and test a theoretical model showing the impacts of pricing policy on corporate proﬁtability. To this end, 150 companies in the metal-mechanic sector situated in the Northeast of Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil were studied, integrating customer value-based pricing strategies, competition-based pricing strategies and cost-based pricing strategies with price levels (high and low) and performance with respect to proﬁtability. The results indicate that the proﬁtability of the surveyed companies is positively affected by value-based pricing strategy and high price levels while it is negatively affected by low price levels. Such ﬁndings indicate that pricing policies inﬂuence the proﬁtability of organizations and therefore, a more strategic look at the pricing process may constitute one aspect that cannot be overlooked by managers.},

Previous work studied pricing mechanisms that compute the price of a query by extending a data seller’s explicit prices on certain queries, or investigated the properties that a pricing function should exhibit without detailing a generic construction. In this work, we present a formal framework for pricing queries over data that allows the construction of general families of pricing functions, with the main goal of avoiding arbitrage. We consider two types of pricing schemes: instance-independent schemes, where the price depends only on the structure of the query, and answer-dependent schemes, where the price also depends on the query output. Our main result is a complete characterization of the structure of pricing functions in both settings, by relating it to properties of a function over a lattice. We use our characterization, together with information-theoretic methods, to construct a variety of arbitrage-free pricing functions. Finally, we discuss various tradeoﬀs in the design space and present techniques for eﬃcient computation of the proposed pricing functions.},

Wireless Sensor Networks ({WSNs}) are the main component of {IoT} which collect data from the environment and transmit the data to the sink nodes. For long service time and low maintenance cost, {WSNs} require adaptive and robust designs to address many issues, e.g., data collection, topology formation, packet forwarding, resource and power optimization, coverage optimization, efﬁcient task allocation, and security. For these issues, sensors have to make optimal decisions from current capabilities and available strategies to achieve desirable goals. This paper reviews numerous applications of the economic and pricing models, known as intelligent rational decision-making methods, to develop adaptive algorithms and protocols for {WSNs}. Besides, we survey a variety of pricing strategies in providing incentives for phone users in crowdsensing applications to contribute their sensing data. Furthermore, we consider the use of some pricing models in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication. Finally, we highlight some important open research issues as well as future research directions of applying economic and pricing models to {IoT}.},

	abstract = {Privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms are crucial for the increasingly common setting in which personal data, such as medical or ﬁnancial records, are analyzed. We provide general techniques to produce privacy-preserving approximations of classiﬁers learned via (regularized) empirical risk minimization ({ERM}). These algorithms are private under the ε-differential privacy deﬁnition due to Dwork et al. (2006). First we apply the output perturbation ideas of Dwork et al. (2006), to {ERM} classiﬁcation. Then we propose a new method, objective perturbation, for privacy-preserving machine learning algorithm design. This method entails perturbing the objective function before optimizing over classiﬁers. If the loss and regularizer satisfy certain convexity and differentiability criteria, we prove theoretical results showing that our algorithms preserve privacy, and provide generalization bounds for linear and nonlinear kernels. We further present a privacypreserving technique for tuning the parameters in general machine learning algorithms, thereby providing end-to-end privacy guarantees for the training process. We apply these results to produce privacy-preserving analogues of regularized logistic regression and support vector machines. We obtain encouraging results from evaluating their performance on real demographic and benchmark data sets. Our results show that both theoretically and empirically, objective perturbation is superior to the previous state-of-the-art, output perturbation, in managing the inherent tradeoff between privacy and learning performance.},

	abstract = {An important class of game-theoretic incentive mechanisms for eliciting effort from a crowd are the peer based mechanisms, in which workers are paid by matching their answers with one another. The other classic mechanism is to have the workers solve some gold standard tasks and pay them according to their accuracy on gold tasks. This mechanism ensures stronger incentive compatibility than the peer based mechanisms but assigning gold tasks to all workers becomes inefﬁcient at large scale. We propose a novel mechanism that assigns gold tasks to only a few workers and exploits transitivity to derive accuracy of the rest of the workers from their peers’ accuracy. We show that the resulting mechanism ensures a dominant notion of incentive compatibility and fairness.},

	title = {A Pricing Model for Data Markets},
	abstract = {As companies and organizations explore the booming frontier of data, they are operating in data markets that are largely unregulated. One of the foremost challenges within these emerging markets is establishing an accepted methodology for assessing the value of datasets. Current data pricing strategies are often driven by the seller, with little visibility into the cost of collection, cleansing, and packaging to the buyer. This asymmetry of information results in a lack of pricing transparency, hurting the seller, who is unable to price optimally in the market, and hurting the buyer, who cannot strategically assess pricing options across data service providers. A more structured data market with a standardized pricing model would improve the transaction experience for all parties. In this paper, we describe a potential dataset valuation model and the impact such a model could have on data markets. We also explore how the model would influence certain practices, such as by adding proprietary datasets as assets on corporate balance sheets, as well as how it could contribute to the formation of a futures market for data.},

	abstract = {This paper considers a market for trading Internet of Things ({IoT}) data that is used to train machine learning models. The data, either raw or processed, is supplied to the market platform through a network and the price of such data is controlled based on the value it brings to the machine learning model. We explore the correlation property of data in a gametheoretical setting to eventually derive a simpliﬁed distributed solution for a data trading mechanism that emphasizes the mutual beneﬁt of devices and the market. The key proposal is an efﬁcient algorithm for markets that jointly addresses the challenges of availability and heterogeneity in participation, as well as the transfer of trust and the economic value of data exchange in {IoT} networks. The proposed approach establishes the data market by reinforcing collaboration opportunities between device with correlated data to avoid information leakage. Therein, we develop a network-wide optimization problem that maximizes the social value of coalition among the {IoT} devices of similar data types; at the same time, it minimizes the cost due to network externalities, i.e., the impact of information leakage due to data correlation, as well as the opportunity costs. Finally, we reveal the structure of the formulated problem as a distributed coalition game and solve it following the simpliﬁed split-andmerge algorithm. Simulation results show the efﬁcacy of our proposed mechanism design toward a trusted {IoT} data market, with up to 32.72\% gain in the average payoff for each seller.},

Traditional data pricing models relied on uniform pricing or subscription-based models. However, with the development of Privacy-Preserving Computing techniques, the market can now protect the privacy and complete transactions using progressively disclosed information, which creates a technical foundation for generating greater social welfare through data usage. In this study, we propose a novel approach to modeling multi-round data trading with progressively disclosed information using a matchmaking-based Markov Decision Process ({MDP}) and introduce a Social Welfareoptimized Data Pricing Mechanism ({SWDPM}) to ﬁnd optimal pricing strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to model multi-round data trading with progressively disclosed information. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the {SWDPM} can increase social welfare 3 times by up to 54\% in trading feasibility, 43\% in trading efﬁciency, and 25\% in trading fairness by encouraging better matching of demand and price negotiation among traders.},

Data pricing, as a key function of a data marketplace, demands quantifying the monetary value of data. A considerable number of studies on data pricing can be found in literature. This paper attempts to comprehensively review the state-of-the-art on existing data pricing studies to provide a general understanding of this emerging research area. Our key contribution lies in a new taxonomy of data pricing studies that uniﬁes different attributes determining data prices. The basis of our framework categorises these studies by the kind of market structure, be it sell-side, buy-side, or two-sided. Then in a sell-side market, the studies are further divided by query type, which deﬁnes the way a data consumer accesses data, while in a buy-side market, the studies are divided according to privacy notion, which deﬁnes the way to quantify privacy of data owners. In a two-sided market, both privacy notion and query type are used as criteria. We systematically examine the studies falling into each category in our taxonomy. Lastly, we discuss gaps within the existing research and deﬁne future research directions.},

	abstract = {We propose modeling real-world data markets, where sellers post ﬁxed prices and buyers are free to purchase from any set of sellers, as a simultaneous-move game between the buyers. A key component of this model is the negative externality buyers induce on one another due to purchasing data with a competitive advantage, a phenomenon exacerbated by data’s easy replicability. We consider two settings. In the simpler complete-information setting, where all buyers know their valuations, we characterize both the existence and welfare properties of the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium in the presence of buyer externality. While this picture is bleak without any market intervention, reinforcing the limitations of current data markets, we prove that for a standard class of externality functions, market intervention in the form of a transaction cost can lead to a pure-strategy equilibrium with strong welfare guarantees. We next consider a more general setting where buyers start with unknown valuations and learn them over time through repeated data purchases. Our intervention is feasible in this regime as well, and we provide a learning algorithm for buyers in this online scenario that under some natural assumptions, achieves low regret with respect to both individual and cumulative utility metrics. Lastly, we analyze the promise and shortfalls of this intervention under a much richer model of externality. Our work paves the way for investigating simple interventions for existing data markets to address their shortcoming and the unique challenges put forth by data products.},

The ﬁrst set of results is pricing strategy independent and reveals the fundamental information-theoretic limitation of any data-based pricing strategy in revenue generation for two cases: 3PD and uniform pricing. The second set of results proposes the -markets empirical revenue maximization ({ERM}) strategy and shows that the -markets {ERM} and the uniform {ERM} strategies achieve the optimal rate of convergence in revenue to that generated by their respective true-distribution 3PD and uniform pricing optima. Our theoretical and numerical results suggest that the uniform (i.e., 1-market) {ERM} strategy generates a larger revenue than the -markets {ERM} strategy when the sample size is small enough, and vice versa.},

In this work, we devise multiparty computation-protocols to compute similarity of two data sets based on correlation, while offering controllable privacy guarantees. We consider a simple model with two participating providers and develop methods to compute exact and approximate correlation, respectively, with controlled information leakage. Both protocols have computational and communication complexities that are linear in the number of data samples.

	shorttitle = {On the Differential Private Data Market},
	abstract = {Privacy is an essential issue in data trading markets. This work uses a mechanism design approach to study the optimal market model to economize the value of privacy of personal data, using differential privacy. The buyer uses a ﬁnite number of randomized algorithms to get access to the owners’ data in a sequential-composition manner, in which each randomized algorithm is differentially private. Each usage of a randomized algorithm is referred to as a period. Motivated by the discovery of an individual’s dual motives for privacy protection, we partition each data owner’s preference over privacy protection into the intrinsic and the instrumental components, in which the instrumental preference arises endogenously from the data buyer’s sequential usages of multiple private algorithms. Due to the composability of differential privacy, there are inevitable privacy losses accumulated over periods. Hence, we allow the owners to leave the market at the end of any period by making stopping decisions. We deﬁne an instrumental kernel function to capture the instrumentalness of owners’ preferences and model the formation of each owner’s (both intrinsic and instrumental) preference over periods by taking into consideration of the composability of differential privacy and time-varying nature of privacy concerns. Our desideratum is to study the buyer’s design regime of optimal market models in dynamic environment when each owner makes coupled decisions of stopping and reporting of their preferences. The buyer seeks to design a privacy allocation rule that dynamically speciﬁes the degree of privacy protections and a payment rule to compensate the privacy losses of the owners. The buyer additionally chooses a payment rule which is independent of owners’ report of their preferences to inﬂuence the owners’ stopping decisions. We characterize the dynamic incentive compatibility and provide a design principle to construct the payment rules in terms of the privacy allocation rule. Further, we relax the buyer’s market design problem and provide a sufﬁcient condition for an approximated dynamic incentive compatible market model.},

	abstract = {There is a growing trend regarding perceiving personal data as a commodity. Existing studies have built frameworks and theories about how to determine an arbitrage-free price of a given query according to the privacy loss quantiﬁed by diﬀerential privacy. However, those studies have assumed that data buyers can purchase query answers with the arbitrary privacy loss of data owners, which may not be valid under strict privacy regulations and data owners’ increasing privacy concerns. In this paper, we study how to empower data owners to control privacy loss in data trading. First, we propose a framework for trading personal data that enables data owners to bound their personalized privacy losses. Second, since bounded privacy losses indicate bounded utilities of query answers, we propose a reasonable relaxation of arbitrage freeness named partial arbitrage freeness, i.e., the guarantee of arbitrage-free pricing only for a limited range of utilities, which provides more possibilities for our market design. Third, to avoid arbitrage, we propose a general method for ensuring arbitrage freeness under personalized diﬀerential privacy. Fourth, to fully utilize data owners’ personalized privacy loss bounds, we propose privacy budget allocation techniques to allocate privacy losses for queries under arbitrage freeness. Finally, we conduct experiments to verify the eﬀectiveness of our proposed trading protocols.},

While a lot of work focuses on reducing the training cost, inference runtime and storage cost of {ML} models, little work studies how to reduce the cost of data acquisition, which potentially leads to a loss of sellers’ revenue and buyers’ affordability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a model-based pricing ({MBP}) framework, which instead of pricing the data, directly prices {ML} model instances. We first formally describe the desired properties of the {MBP} framework, with a focus on avoiding arbitrage. Next, we show a concrete realization of the {MBP} framework via a noise injection approach, which provably satisfies the desired formal properties. Based on the proposed framework, we then provide algorithmic solutions on how the seller can assign prices to models under different market scenarios (such as to maximize revenue). Finally, we conduct extensive experiments, which validate that the {MBP} framework can provide high revenue to the seller, high affordability to the buyer, and also operate on low runtime cost.},

The optimal model delivers stable high performance(over 60\% accurancy) on out-of-sample test periods. In a realistic trading simulation setting, the prediction made by the model could be easily monetized. Moreover, this study shows that the {LSTM} model could extract universal features from tradeby-trade data, as the learned parameters well maintain their high performance on other cryptocurrency instruments that were not included in training data.

	abstract = {Dynamic pricing is used to maximize the revenue of a ﬁrm over a ﬁnite-period planning horizon, given that the ﬁrm may not know the underlying demand curve a priori. In emerging markets, in particular, ﬁrms constantly adjust pricing strategies to collect adequate demand information, which is a process known as price experimentation. To date, few papers have investigated the pricing decision process in a competitive environment with unknown demand curves, conditions that make analysis more complex. Asynchronous price updating can render the demand information gathered by price experimentation less informative or inaccurate, as it is nearly impossible for ﬁrms to remain informed about the latest prices set by competitors. Hence, ﬁrms may set prices using available, yet out-of-date, price information of competitors.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16805},
	abstract = {We introduce the concept of fresh data trading, in which a destination user requests, and pays for, fresh data updates from a source provider, and data freshness is captured by the age of information ({AoI}) metric. Keeping data fresh relies on costly frequent data updates by the source, which motivates the source to price fresh data. In this work, the destination incurs an age-related cost, modeled as a general increasing function of the {AoI}. The source designs a pricing mechanism to maximize its proﬁt, while the destination chooses a data update schedule to trade off its payments to the source and its age-related cost. Depending on different real-time applications and scenarios, we study both a ﬁnite-horizon model and an inﬁnite-horizon model with time discounting. The key challenge of designing the optimal pricing scheme lies in the destination’s time-interdependent valuations, due to the nature of {AoI}, and the inﬁnite-dimensional dynamic optimization. To this end, we exploit three different dimensions in designing pricing by studying three pricing schemes: a time-dependent pricing scheme, in which the price for each update depends on when it is requested; a quantity-based pricing scheme, in which the price of each update depends on how many updates have been previously requested; and a simple subscription-based pricing scheme, in which the price per update is constant but the source charges an additional subscription fee. Our analysis reveals that (1) the optimal subscription-based pricing maximizes the source’s proﬁt among all possible pricing schemes under both ﬁnite-horizon and inﬁnite-horizon models; (2) the optimal quantity-based pricing scheme is only optimal with a ﬁnite horizon; and (3) the timedependent pricing scheme, under the inﬁnite-horizon model with signiﬁcant time discounting, is asymptotically optimal. Numerical results show that the proﬁt-maximizing pricing schemes can also lead to signiﬁcant reductions in {AoI} and social costs, and that a moderate degree of time discounting is enough to achieve a close-to-optimal time-dependent pricing scheme.},

	abstract = {Prediction {APIs} offered for a fee are a fast-growing industry and an important part of machine learning as a service. While many such services are available, the heterogeneity in their price and performance makes it challenging for users to decide which {API} or combination of {APIs} to use for their own data and budget. We take a ﬁrst step towards addressing this challenge by proposing {FrugalML}, a principled framework that jointly learns the strength and weakness of each {API} on different data, and performs an efﬁcient optimization to automatically identify the best sequential strategy to adaptively use the available {APIs} within a budget constraint. Our theoretical analysis shows that natural sparsity in the formulation can be leveraged to make {FrugalML} efﬁcient. We conduct systematic experiments using {ML} {APIs} from Google, Microsoft, Amazon, {IBM}, Baidu and other providers for tasks including facial emotion recognition, sentiment analysis and speech recognition. Across various tasks, {FrugalML} can achieve up to 90\% cost reduction while matching the accuracy of the best single {API}, or up to 5\% better accuracy while matching the best {API}’s cost.},

In this paper, we study how the data broker can maximize her cumulative revenue by posting reasonable prices for sequential queries. We thus propose a contextual dynamic pricing mechanism with the reserve price constraint, which features the properties of ellipsoid for efﬁcient online optimization, and can support linear and non-linear market value models with uncertainty. In particular, under low uncertainty, our pricing mechanism provides a worst-case regret logarithmic in the number of queries. We further extend to other similar application scenarios, including hospitality service, online advertising, and loan application, and extensively evaluate three pricing instances of noisy linear query, accommodation rental, and impression over {MovieLens} 20M dataset, Airbnb listings in U.S. major cities, and Avazu mobile ad click dataset, respectively. The analysis and evaluation results reveal that our proposed pricing mechanism incurs low practical regret, online latency, and memory overhead, and also demonstrate that the existence of reserve price can mitigate the cold-start problem in a posted price mechanism, and thus can reduce the cumulative regret.},

Data freshness is captured by the age of information ({AoI}) metric, deﬁned as the time elapsed since the latest update has reached the destination. The source incurs an operational cost, modeled as an increasing convex function of the number of updates. The destination incurs an age-related cost, modeled as an increasing convex function of the {AoI}. The source charges the destination for each update and designs a pricing mechanism to maximize its proﬁt; the destination on the other hand chooses a data update schedule to minimize the summation of its payments to the source and its age-related cost. The interaction among the source and destination is hence gametheoretic. Motivated by the existing pricing literature, we ﬁrst study a time-dependent pricing scheme, in which the price for each update depends on when it is requested. We show in this case that the game equilibrium leads to only one data update, which does not yield the maximum proﬁt to the source. This motivates us to consider a quantity-based pricing scheme, in which the price of each update depends on how many updates have been previously requested. We show that among all pricing schemes in which the price of an update may vary according to both time and quantity, the quantity-based pricing scheme performs best: it maximizes the source’s proﬁt and minimizes the social cost of the system, deﬁned as the aggregate source’s operational cost and the destination’s age-related cost. Numerical results show that the optimal quantity-based pricing can be 27\% more proﬁtable for the source and incurs 54\% less social cost, compared with the optimal time-dependent pricing.},

	abstract = {In the big data era, personal data is, recently, perceived as a new oil or currency in the digital world. Both public and private sectors wish to use such data for studies and businesses. However, access to such data is restricted due to privacy issues. Seeing the commercial opportunities in gaps between demand and supply, the notion of personal data market is introduced. While there are several challenges associated with rendering such a market operational, we focus on two main technical challenges: (1) How should personal data be fairly traded under a similar e-commerce platform? (2) How much should personal data be worth in trade? In this paper, we propose a practical personal data trading framework that strikes a balance between money and privacy. To acquire insight on user preferences, we first conduct an online survey on human attitude toward privacy and interest in personal data trading. Second, we identify five key principles of the personal data trading central to designing a reasonable trading framework and pricing mechanism. Third, we propose a reasonable trading framework for personal data, which provides an overview of how data are traded. Fourth, we propose a balanced pricing mechanism that computes the query price and perturbed results for data buyers and compensation for data owners (whose data are used) as a function of their privacy loss. Finally, we conduct an experiment on our balanced pricing mechanism, and the result shows that our balanced pricing mechanism performs significantly better than the baseline mechanism.},

While a lot of work focuses on reducing the training cost, inference runtime and storage cost of {ML} models, little work studies how to reduce the cost of data acquisition, which potentially leads to a loss of sellers’ revenue and buyers’ affordability and efﬁciency. In this paper, we propose a model-based pricing ({MBP}) framework, which instead of pricing the data, directly prices {ML} model instances. We ﬁrst formally describe the desired properties of the {MBP} framework, with a focus on avoiding arbitrage. Next, we show a concrete realization of the {MBP} framework via a noise injection approach, which provably satisﬁes the desired formal properties. Based on the proposed framework, we then provide algorithmic solutions on how the seller can assign prices to models under different market scenarios (such as to maximize revenue). Finally, we conduct extensive experiments, which validate that the {MBP} framework can provide high revenue to the seller, high affordability to the buyer, and also operate on low runtime cost.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in technology enable public or commercial establishments (for e.g. malls, coffee shops, airports) and individual data plan subscribers to operate as Wi-Fi providers ({WFP}), offering Internet access. However, the model of a monthly flat service fee charged by {ISP} to establishment or individual {WFPs} offers very little incentives for {ISP} to provide additional bandwidth to {WFP}’s customers. Thus, these users may experience insufficient bandwidth when there is high demand for bandwidth. In addition, {ISP} even discourages individual subscribers to provide Internet access through their smartphone because such practices may cause market saturation. To address this, in this paper we propose a dynamic pricing scheme and a revenue sharing mechanism that provide incentives for {ISP} to support establishment and individual Wi-Fi providers offering Internet access to users. Our revenue sharing model is based on Shapley value mechanism. Importantly, our proposed revenue sharing mechanism captures the power negotiation between {ISP} and Wi-Fi providers, and how shifts in the power balance between the two entities influence revenue division. Specifically, the model assures that the party who contributes more receives a higher portion of the revenue. In addition to that, the division of revenue eventually converges to a percentage value.},

For these issues, sensors have to make optimal decisions from current capabilities and available strategies to achieve desirable goals. This paper reviews numerous applications of the economic and pricing models, known as intelligent rational decision-making methods, to develop adaptive algorithms and protocols for {WSNs}. Besides, we survey a variety of pricing strategies in providing incentives for phone users in crowdsensing applications to contribute their sensing data. Furthermore, we consider the use of some pricing models in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication.

In this work, we present a formal framework for pricing queries over data that allows the construction of general families of pricing functions, with the main goal of avoiding arbitrage. We consider two types of pricing schemes: instance-independent schemes, where the price depends only on the structure of the query, and answer-dependent schemes, where the price also depends on the query output. Our main result is a complete characterization of the structure of pricing functions in both settings, by relating it to properties of a function over a lattice. We use our characterization, together with information-theoretic methods, to construct a variety of arbitrage-free pricing functions.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04023},
	abstract = {Mobile users’ correlated mobility and data consumption patterns often lead to severe cellular network congestion in peak hours and hot spots. This paper presents an optimal design of time and location aware mobile data pricing, which incentivizes users to smooth trafﬁc and reduce network congestion. We derive the optimal pricing scheme through analyzing a two-stage decision process, where the operator determines the time and location aware prices by minimizing his total cost in Stage I, and each mobile user schedules his mobile trafﬁc by maximizing his payoff (i.e., utility minus payment) in Stage {II}. We formulate the two-stage decision problem as a bilevel optimization problem, and propose a derivative-free algorithm to solve the problem for any increasing concave user utility functions. We further develop low complexity algorithms for the commonly used logarithmic and linear utility functions. The optimal pricing scheme ensures a win-win situation for the operator and users. Simulations show that the operator can reduce the cost by up to 97.52\% in the logarithmic utility case and 98.70\% in the linear utility case, and users can increase their payoff by up to 79.69\% and 106.10\% for the two types of utilities, respectively, comparing with a time and location independent pricing benchmark. Our study suggests that the operator should provide price discounts at less crowded time slots and locations, and the discounts need to be signiﬁcant when the operator’s cost of provisioning excessive trafﬁc is high or users’ willingness to delay trafﬁc is low.},

	abstract = {Price policy deﬁnition is one of the most important decisions in management as it affects corporate proﬁtability and market competitiveness. Despite the importance that prices take in organizations, it appears that this element has not received proper attention by many academics and marketers since it represents, according to estimates, less than 2\% of the papers on leading journals in the ﬁeld. Thus, the aim of this study was to propose and test a theoretical model showing the impacts of pricing policy on corporate proﬁtability. To this end, 150 companies in the metal-mechanic sector situated in the Northeast of Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil were studied, integrating customer value-based pricing strategies, competition-based pricing strategies and cost-based pricing strategies with price levels (high and low) and performance with respect to proﬁtability. The results indicate that the proﬁtability of the surveyed companies is positively affected by value-based pricing strategy and high price levels while it is negatively affected by low price levels. Such ﬁndings indicate that pricing policies inﬂuence the proﬁtability of organizations and therefore, a more strategic look at the pricing process may constitute one aspect that cannot be overlooked by managers.},

	abstract = {The wide variety of pricing policies used in practice by data-sellers suggests that there are signi cant challenges in pricing datasets. In this paper, we develop a utility framework that is appropriate for data-buyers and the corresponding pricing of the data by the data-seller. A buyer interested in purchasing a dataset has private valuations in two aspects   her ideal record that she values the most, and the rate at which her valuation for the records in the dataset decays as they di er from her ideal record. The seller allows individual buyers to  lter the dataset and select the records that are of interest to them. The multi-dimensional private information of the buyers coupled with the endogenous selection of records makes the seller's problem of optimally pricing the dataset a challenging one. We formulate a tractable model and successfully exploit its special structure to obtain optimal and near-optimal data-selling mechanisms. Speci cally, we provide insights into the conditions under which a commonly-used mechanism   namely, a price-quantity schedule   is optimal for the data-seller. When the conditions leading to the optimality of a price-quantity schedule do not hold, we show that the optimal price-quantity schedule o ers an attractive worst-case guarantee relative to an optimal mechanism. Further, we numerically solve for the optimal mechanism and show that the actual performance of two simple and well-known price-quantity schedules   namely, two-part tari  and two-block tari    is near-optimal. We also quantify the value to the seller from allowing buyers to  lter the dataset.},

	abstract = {We consider crowdsourcing problems where the workers are asked to provide evaluations for items; the worker evaluations are then used to estimate the true quality of items. Lacking an incentive scheme, workers have no motive in making effort in completing the evaluations, providing inaccurate answers instead. We show that a simple approach of providing incentives by assessing randomly chosen workers is not scalable: to guarantee an incentive to be truthful the number of workers that the supervisor needs to assess grows linearly with total number of workers. To address the scalability problem, we propose incentive schemes that are truthful and cheap: the truthful as the optimal worker behavior consists in providing accurate evaluations, and cheap because the truthfulness is achieved with little supervision cost. We consider both discrete evaluation tasks, where an evaluation can be done either correctly, or incorrectly, with no degrees of approximation in between, and quantitative evaluation tasks, where evaluations are real numbers, and the error is measured as distance from the correct value. For both types of tasks, we develop hierarchical incentive schemes that can be effected with a small amount of supervised evaluations, and that scale to arbitrarily large crowd sizes: they have the property that the strength of the incentive does not weaken with increasing hierarchy depth. We show that the proposed hierarchical schemes are robust: they provide incentives in heterogeneous environments where workers can have limited proﬁciencies, as long as there are enough proﬁcient workers in the crowd. Interestingly, we also show that for these schemes to work, the only requisite is that workers know their place in the hierarchy in advance.},

	abstract = {Machine learning is disruptive. At the same time, machine learning can only succeed by collaboration among many parties in multiple steps naturally as pipelines in an eco-system, such as collecting data for possible machine learning applications, collaboratively training models by multiple parties and delivering machine learning services to end users. Data is critical and penetrating in the whole machine learning pipelines. As machine learning pipelines involve many parties and, in order to be successful, have to form a constructive and dynamic eco-system, marketplaces and data pricing are fundamental in connecting and facilitating those many parties. In this article, we survey the principles and the latest research development of data pricing in machine learning pipelines. We start with a brief review of data marketplaces and pricing desiderata. Then, we focus on pricing in three important steps in machine learning pipelines. To understand pricing in the step of training data collection, we review pricing raw data sets and data labels. We also investigate pricing in the step of collaborative training of machine learning models, and overview pricing machine learning models for end users in the step of machine learning deployment. We also discuss a series of possible future directions.},

	title = {Data Shapley: Equitable Valuation of Data for Machine Learning},
	abstract = {As data becomes the fuel driving technological and economic growth, a fundamental challenge is how to quantify the value of data in algorithmic predictions and decisions. For example, in healthcare and consumer markets, it has been suggested that individuals should be compensated for the data that they generate, but it is not clear what is an equitable valuation for individual data. In this work, we develop a principled framework to address data valuation in the context of supervised machine learning. Given a learning algorithm trained on n data points to produce a predictor, we propose data Shapley as a metric to quantify the value of each training datum to the predictor performance. Data Shapley uniquely satisﬁes several natural properties of equitable data valuation. We develop Monte Carlo and gradient-based methods to efﬁciently estimate data Shapley values in practical settings where complex learning algorithms, including neural networks, are trained on large datasets. In addition to being equitable, extensive experiments across biomedical, image and synthetic data demonstrate that data Shapley has several other beneﬁts: 1) it is more powerful than the popular leave-one-out or leverage score in providing insight on what data is more valuable for a given learning task; 2) low Shapley value data effectively capture outliers and corruptions; 3) high Shapley value data inform what type of new data to acquire to improve the predictor.},
